django-extjs4-forms
===================

Use your regular django forms (forms.py) to create extjs4 forms in your formpanels on the fly.

This is taken, in large part, from [https://github.com/revolunet/django-extjs]

Setup
======
Stuff in the Static folder should go into an area that can be read by your html/javascript. (ie wherever you usually put your javascript/css/images).

The stuff in the src directory can be manually manipulated or you can use setup.py (usual commands).
